This folder contains the source files that will be processed by the Hugo asset/resource pipeline
The `resources` folder will contain the "compiled" assets - e.g. SASS->CSS conversions, minified, etc.

To make resources available, you need to run Hugo against the theme folder so that the resources folder
is populated.
